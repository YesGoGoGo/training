This is a repository of exercises and classes that I've done / am doing to continually sharpen my craft.  This is where you get to see how little I know :)

## License Info
The code in this repository should be considered "read only", in that it's here to show you what I've worked on, and hopefully inspire you to learn more on your own.  These answers aren't here for you to copy paste, and there's really nothing here for you to expand on or modify.

Furthermore, some of the code in this repository is taken from the associated books / courses.  In those cases, the code is licensed under the original authors work, and nothing should be assumed about the license on that code.  If you plan to do anything with it, please see the original sources for license information.
