This is a collection of the lessons I completed while learning programming with Learn Python the Hard Way.  I thoroughly enjoyed and was inspired by this book, especially (as the home page says) that it taught '...a lot more than the basics of programming, and Python. It teaches important life skills in every facet of life: attention to detail, persistence & that dedicated practice and application lead to results.'  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the mentality and peripheral skills needed to be a solid programmer.  And if you do the extra credit, you'll learn a lot of hte basics of Python also.  Oh, and it's not really "hard".  It's only hard because you have to do things that are annoying, like type in all the exercises, go out to the internet to proactively seek information and solutions, and attempt to figure things out before the author tells you the answer.  It's actually easier in many ways because it removes a lot of the jargon, which makes for a clear head.
