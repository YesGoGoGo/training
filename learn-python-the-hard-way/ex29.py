#extra credit
# 1. what do you think the if does to code under it?
# a: passes through the line of code and evaluates the statement and returns true or false; if it is true, then it will continue to operate with what is written below

# 2. why does the code need to be indented under it by 4 spaces
# a: because if is a funtion

# 3: what happens if it isn't indented?
# a: then the line will just get printed

# 4. can you put other booleann expressions fron ex. 27 in the if-statement? try it

# 5. what hapens if you change the intial variables for people cants and dogs?
